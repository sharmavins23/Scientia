Linear circuits are a type of [[Analog Circuits|analog circuit]] which obeys the [[System#Linear (Principle of Superposition)|principle of superposition]]:

$$
F(ax_1+bx_2) = aF(x_1) + bF(x_2)
$$

This means that the output of the circuit when a linear combination of input signals is applied is equivalent to the individual signals' linear combination, when separately passed through the circuit.
