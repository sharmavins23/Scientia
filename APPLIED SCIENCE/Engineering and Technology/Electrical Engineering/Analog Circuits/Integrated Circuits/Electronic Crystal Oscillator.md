An electronic crystal oscillator (or clock generator), is a chip that generates a symmetrical square wave for computer systems. It is an [[Integrated Circuits (Analog)|analog integrated circuit]].

## Construction

Crystal oscillator chips are usually designed from [[quartz]] [[piezo-electric]] materials. They can also be created out of simple [[Inductor-Capacitor (LC) Tank|tank circuits]] or even RC oscillator circuits.

## Clock Dividers and Trees

A clock signal can be divided by some power of two by the use of a [[counter]]. Such a circuit is called a clock divider circuit. More complicated division structures can be created called clock trees, which are useful in systems where many differing clock speeds are used in parallel.
