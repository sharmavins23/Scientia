A Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a system is the most important processor of a modern-day computing device. It handles the vast majority of processing and handling of instructions.

These days, the CPU handles basic computations with extreme flexibility, and white not very performant, acts as an inter-operation point between other more specific devices.

CPUs generally contain one particular [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]], and as such run one particular instruction set.

## Construction

CPUs are generally made up of a variety of parts and have notable statistics alongside them. Generally, these statistics determine its performance in a very direct sense.

The following components are common within CPUs:

- [[CPU Cores]];
	- Within cores, there are [[CPU Cores#Threads|threads]];
- [[Electronic Crystal Oscillator|Clock generators]];
- [[Cache Memory|Cache systems]].
