A streaming multiprocessor (as defined in NVIDIA [[CUDA]] [[Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)|GPUs]]) is a subdivision of a graphics card capable of processing in high parallelization. An SM may handle several thread blocks; One thread block may consist of several warps; A warp is a hardware grouping of threads. SMs utilize [[Single Instruction, Multiple Dispatch (SIMT)|SIMT]] parallelization to compute in highly parallel and efficient manners.
