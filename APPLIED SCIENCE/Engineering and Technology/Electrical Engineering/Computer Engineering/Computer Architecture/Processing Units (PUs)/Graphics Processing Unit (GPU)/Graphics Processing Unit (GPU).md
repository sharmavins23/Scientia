A graphics card is a discrete [[Processing Units (PUs)|PU]], usually packaged into a [[Peripheral Component Interconnect Express|PCI-e expansion card]], that usually generates a feed of [[Graphics|graphical]] output to a display device, such as a [[Monitor|monitor]]. Most graphics cards are not limited to graphical display, and can instead be utilized for additional highly parallelized processing; Additional platforms such as [[OpenCL|openCL]] or [[CUDA|CUDA]] allow for general-purpose computing.

The graphics card houses the graphics processing unit, a discrete processor designed towards computations of high parallel scale.

## Structure

A modern graphics processing unit may contain the following types of cores:

- [[Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)|Streaming multiprocessors (SMs)]]
- [[Tensor Core|Tensor cores]]
