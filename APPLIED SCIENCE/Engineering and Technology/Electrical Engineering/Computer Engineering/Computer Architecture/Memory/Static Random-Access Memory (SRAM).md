SRAM is a type of [[Random-Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]] using [[Flip-Flop|latching circuitry]] in order to store each bit. SRAM is volatile, and data is lost when power is removed. Notably, SRAM is static - The RAM will hold its data permanently when powered. It is faster than other types of RAM, but is more expensive in terms of silicon area and cost. As such, it's typically used for the [[Cache Memory|cache]] (within a CPU) and even some [[Register Memory|registers]].
