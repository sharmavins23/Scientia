DRAM is a type of [[Random-Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]] that stores each bit of data in a memory cell circuit, consisting of a tiny [[Capacitor|capacitor]] and a MOS [[Transistor|transistor]]. DRAM is *dynamic* in that charge leaks over use, and needs to be routinely re-charged. DRAM is considered slow (as far as RAM goes), but is relatively cheap, and is used for main memory systems.
