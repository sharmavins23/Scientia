Random-access memory is computer memory that can be read and changed in any order. In particular, memory is considered random-access if the time to read any random value is *constant*. This is in contrast to older [[Hard Disk Memory|disk style memory systems]] where read times are not constant.

Generally, RAM is [[Memory (Computing)#Volatility|volatile]], though non-volatile forms have been designed (such as most forms of [[Read-Only Memory (ROM)|ROM]], as well as [[NOR Flash Memory|NOR flash memory]]).

There are two types of RAM: [[SRAM|SRAM]] and [[DRAM|DRAM]].
