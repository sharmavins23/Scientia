ROM is generally [[Memory (Computing)#Volatility|non-volatile]] memory used in computers. As the name suggests, it cannot be modified, and is instead pre-loaded with particular information.

ROM is often used for security purposes (such as storing [[cryptographic keys]] or [[Media Access Control ID|MAC IDs]]). It also stores device firmware or other data that is seldom changed in the system.

## Write Capability

Strictly speaking, ROM devices by definition should not be programmable or re-writeable. However, [[EPROM|erasable programmable ROM (EPROM)]] and [[EEPROM|electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM)]] modules exist. These designs can be rewritten, but often are slow to rewrite or have a limited number of writes available. In the modern day and age, [[NAND Flash Memory||NAND flash memory]] is utilized in lieu of EEPROM.
