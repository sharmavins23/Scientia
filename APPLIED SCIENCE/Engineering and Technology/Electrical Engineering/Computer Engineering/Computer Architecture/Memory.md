Computer memory refers to particular circuits that store data.

## Types

There are several ways of categorizing memory. One of the popular ones is by reading speed and efficiency:

1. [[Read-Only Memory (ROM)]];
2. [[Hard Disk Memory]];
3. [[Solid-State Memory]];
4. [[Random Access Memory (RAM)]];
5. [[Cache Memory]];
6. [[Register Memory]].

These are also ordered based on decreasing proximity to the CPU [[Datapath|datapath]] as well, and are also ordered in terms of increasing cost to increase.

## Volatility

Some circuit designs for memory discharge slowly over time and over use, and others discharge when read. Memory that needs to be recharged is called 'volatile' memory, as it will reset when power is lost. Memory that does not need to be recharged and can last for longer periods of time is called non-volatile memory or non-volatile storage.
