An ALU is a device designed for performing arithmetic and logical operations within a datapath. It is a [[combinatorial]] digital circuit that generally takes in some control signals from a [[control unit]] and spits out answers without any clock dependencies (though, in some designs, ALUs may have clocked cycles).

ALUs only operate on binary integers, in contrast to [[floating-point units]], which support [[Floating-Point|floating-point]] types.

The ALU is the fundamental building component of a wide variety of [[Processing Units (PUs)]], including CPUs and GPUs.
