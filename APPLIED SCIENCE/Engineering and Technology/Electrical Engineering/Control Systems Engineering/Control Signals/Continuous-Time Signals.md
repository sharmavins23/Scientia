Continuous-time [[Control Signals|signals]] are signals that exist at any point on the time axis. As they are continuous, any time divisions are not limited to countable values.

## Properties

### Parity

Continuous-time signals may be either 'even' or 'odd'. A signal is even if:

$$
x(-t) = x(t)
$$

A signal is odd if:

$$
x(-t) = -x(t)
$$
