The Von Neumann architecture, or model, or Princeton architecture, is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann. His document details a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with the following components:

- A processing unit with both an [[arithmetic logic unit]] and processor registers;
- A control unit that includes an instruction [[register]] and program counter;
- [[Memory]] that stores data and instructions;
- External mass storage;
- Input and output mechanisms.

The term has since evolved to refer to any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data write operation cannot occur at the same time. This is referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck, which limits the performance of the system. These problems are also called [[Pipelining (Computation)#Hazards|hazards]].

Modern computers apply various techniques to speed up performance, such as [[Pipelining (Computation)|pipelines]]. Computers also employ [[caches]] between the [[CPU]] and memory, enabling extreme performance improvements.
