MIPS, or Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages, is a family of reduced instruction set computer ([[RISC]]) instruction set architectures ([[Instruction Set Architecture|ISAs]]). The architecture is now deprecated and is not in production on computers, but is instead utilized as an educational tool.

Other than load and store memory operations, all instructions operate on [[register|registers]]. For this, MIPS has 32 32-bit general-purpose registers.

MIPS has three individual instruction formats:

1. Register-type (R-type) instructions focus on register operations, such as adding, subtracting, multiplication.
2. Immediate-type (I-type) instructions allow for an immediate value to be applied to a register operation, which speeds up performance with constants.
3. Jump-type (J-type) instructions allow for program [[control flow]] branching.
