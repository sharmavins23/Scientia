A biological neuron is comprised of a [[Neuron (Biology)#Soma|soma]], or cell body. It has a series of [[Neuron (Biology)#Dendrites|dendrites]], or inputs, connected to it. When the potential of the soma reaches a certain threshold it fires a spike down the [[axon]], or output, towards the [[synapses]] of other neurons.

The synapses themselves may carry some weight, and this weight is (potentially) utilized to compute a summing of the inputs on the dendritic segments. The input neuron is referred to as the presynaptic neuron, and the receiving neuron is referred to as the postsynaptic neuron.

Neurons are typically generated by [[neural stem cells]] during brain development and childhood in a process known as [[neurogenesis]], which largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.

The neuron is the main component of [[nervous tissue]] in all animals except sponges and [[placozoa]]. Non-animals like plants and fungi do not have nerve cells.

## Types of Neurons

There are three types of neurons:

1. [[Sensory neurons]] respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the [[sensory organs]]. They send signals to the [[spinal cord]] or [[brain]].
2. [[Motor neurons]] receive signals form the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output.
3. [[Interneurons]] connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.

Multiple neurons functionally connected together form a [[neural circuit]].

### Soma

The [[soma]] is the body of the neuron. It contains the nucleus of the cell, so protein synthesis occurs here. Generically, the soma contains the simple cell body as well.

### Dendrites

The [[dendrites]] are tree-like extensions of the cell. These are usually visualized as growths from the cell, but are 'inputs' rather than 'outputs' to the cell itself.

### Axon

The [[axon]] is a finer cable-like projection extending tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. It carries nerve signals and outputs away from the soma, and carries some type of information back to it.

### Membrane

The cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a [[plasma membrane]], which is a bilayer of [[lipid]] molecules with many types of protein structures embedded within.
