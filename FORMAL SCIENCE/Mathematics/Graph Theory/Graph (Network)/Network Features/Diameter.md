Diameter, denoted by $d_{max}$, is the largest [[Path#Distance|distance]] between any two nodes in the graph. Notably, it is **not** the largest path length; It is simply the largest of the set of *shortest* paths between two nodes.

$$
d_{max} = \max{d_{ij}} \text{ } \forall i,j\in\{1, ..., n\}, i\neq j
$$
