A component in a [[Graph (Network)|graph]] is a subgraph. Components are simply groupings of [[Node|nodes]] that are all interconnected, such that there exists some path between every pair of nodes in the subgraph, and no edge exists between the subgraph and the rest of the nodes in a graph.

By definition, this means that components MUST be disconnected from the remainder of the graph.

## Component Size

The size of a component is counted simply from the number of nodes within the component.

## Largest Component

The largest component is simply the largest sized component. This is also referred to as the giant component, though originally that term only referred to a majority component (by fractional size of the full graph).
