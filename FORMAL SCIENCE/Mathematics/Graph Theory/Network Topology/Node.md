A node in a [[Network|graph]] represents a particular data point, or thing that can be connected. Nodes are generally connected via [[Vertex|vertices]].

Not all nodes must be connected through some direct or indirect path. A connected component is defined as a group of nodes that is connected between direct or indirect paths. As such, a component $C$ is always in the follow relationship with all nodes $N$:

$$
C\subseteq N
$$
