Networks (also known as graphs) are representations, or models, of physical, [[Biology|biological]], social, and engineering-based systems. Often, they are visually depicted as graphs, and studied in a process known as [[Graph Theory|graph theory]].

Networks are comprised of [[Node|nodes]] and [[Vertex|vertices]]. They can be represented within [[Adjacency Matrix|adjacency matrices]].

## Features

Networks have a series of different values that can be computed from them:

### Degree

The degree of a node in a network represents the number of connections it has, and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network.

### Clustering Coefficient

A clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. Evidence suggests that in real-world networks (and in particular, [[social networks]]), nodes tend to cluster together tightly due to high density of ties.

### Diameter

Diameter is the greatest distance between any two connected nodes. This links back to a "small-world" theory - Human social connections are theorized to have a diameter of 6, as humans have 6 degrees of separation, supposedly.

### Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality is a way of detecting the amount of influence one node has over information flow in a graph.

### Assortative/Dissortative Mixing

This value asks whether nodes with similar attributes are more or less likely to link to each other.

### Largest Component

Components are groupings of nodes that are all interconnected. As such, the largest component is simply the largest set of nodes that are all interconnected.

### Connectivity

Connectivity refers to whether a path is connected between two nodes. A graph is connected if all nodes are connected to each other. A graph is $k$-connected if there are at least $k$ mutually disjoint paths between any two nodes. As such, the graph will remain connected despite the removal of any $(k-1)$ nodes or edges.
