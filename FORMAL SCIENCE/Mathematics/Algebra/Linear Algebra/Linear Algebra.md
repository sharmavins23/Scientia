Linear algebra is the branch of [[Algebra|algebra]] dealing with particular linear equations such as:

$$
a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n = b
$$

It also deals with linear maps such as:

$$
(x_1, \dots, x_n) \to a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n
$$

Linear algebra also deals with their representations in [[Vector Space|vector spaces]], and through [[Matrix|matrices]].
