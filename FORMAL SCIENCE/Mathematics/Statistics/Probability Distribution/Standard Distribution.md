The Standard Distribution (or Normal Distribution) is a type of [[Probability Distribution|continuous probability distribution]] for a real-valued random variable. The probability density function is:

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$

This is for some mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
