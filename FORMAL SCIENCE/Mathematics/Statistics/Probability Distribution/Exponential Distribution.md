The exponential [[Probability Distribution|distribution]] is the probability distribution of the distance between events in a process where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The [[Probability Density Function|PDF]] is:

$$
f(x;\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
$$

The function is defined for $x\geq 0$, and the mean is $\mu=\lambda^{-1}$ with standard deviation $\sigma = \mu$.
