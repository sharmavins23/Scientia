A linked list is a [[Data Structures|data structure]] that stores data. Unlike [[Array|arrays]], linked lists do not have to be contiguous, nor do their objects have to be the same sizing. Linked lists utilize [[pointer|pointers]] in order to point to the next elements.

Accessing data from a linked list may be done in $O(n)$ worst-case time for $n$ elements. The linked list takes up $O(n)$ space.
