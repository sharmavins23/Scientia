In [[Computer Science|computer science]], a binary representation is a representation of data with two 'bits' of precision, or two particular states - On or off. This lends itself well to [[digital circuits]].

Numbers in binary are represented in base-2. For instance, the counting numbers (from 0 upwards) are: `000`, `001`, `010`, `011`, `100`, etc.
