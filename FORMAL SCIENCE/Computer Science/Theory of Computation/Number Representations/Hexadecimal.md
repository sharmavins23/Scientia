Hexadecimal is a base-16 numerical representation used often in [[Computer Science]] and [[Computer Engineering]] where numbers are represented through characters 0-9, A-F. For instance, the following is a binary value for the number "18,213":

```
B: 0100 0111 0010 0101
H: 4    7    2    5
```

Hexadecimal values each correspond to four binary values, or 16 decimal values. This allows them to represent pairs of computer [[bytes]] well. Usually, hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with `0x`. So, decimal 18,213 would be binary `0b0100011100100101`, and hexadecimal `0x4725`. Hexadecimal is case-insensitive.
