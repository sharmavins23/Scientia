A cellular [[Finite Automata|automaton]] is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. They are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tesselation structures, and iterative arrays. Cellular automata have found applications in [[Physics|physics]], [[Biology|theoretical biology]], and microstructural modeling.
