Lenia (Latin: *lenis*, "smooth") is a family of [[Cellular Automata|cellular automata]] created by Bert Wang-Chak Chan. It is a continuous generalization of [[Conway's Game of Life]], with continuous states, space, and time. The complex autonomous patterns described model [[Biology|biological]] patterns and behaviors to an extreme level.

Over 400 unique 'species' of life have been discovered through simulation, and their own unique taxonomic structure has been observed based on features and characteristics.
