In [[Automata Theory|automata theory]], automata are state machines that have some notion of memory as well as some notion of travelling from state to state. As such, they can implement [[Algorithms|algorithms]].

State machines in general (or [[Markov Chain|Markov chains]], or [[Mealy Machine|Mealy]]/[[Moore Machine|Moore]] machines) are generally [[Graph (Network)|directed graphs]] with predictable travel sequences.

## Types

The following is a (probably incomplete) list of automata, ordered from lowest to greatest computational power:

- [[Finite Automata|Deterministic finite automata]] and [[Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)|nondeterministic finite automata]];
- [[Deterministic Push Down Automata (DPDA)|Deterministic push down automata]];
- [[Nondeterministic Push Down Automata (NPDA)|Nondeterministic push down automata]];
- [[Linear Bounded Automata (LBA)|Linear bounded automata]];
- [[Turing Machine (TM)|Deterministic Turing machines]], [[Nondeterminstic Turing Machine (NTM)|nondeterministic Turing machines]], [[Probabilistic Turing Machine (PTM)|probabilistic Turing machines]], [[Multitape Turing Machine (MTM)|multitape Turing machines]], [[Multidimensional Turing Machine|multidimensional Turing machines]]
