An activation function is an arbitrary function used in [[Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)|FNNs]] to calculate the output of a [[Artificial Neuron|node]]. Without a non-linear activation function, the outputs would simply collide and fail to cluster properly on an $n$-dimensional input-output graph; With the activation function, the 'dials' of weights and biases will be able to encapsulate more complicated shapes.
