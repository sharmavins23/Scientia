IST, also known as Independent Subnet Training, is a class of [[Machine Learning|NN]] training [[Algorithms|algorithms]] dealing with the decomposition of a neural network into a set of individual smaller networks. These smaller networks may be trained separately before being synchronized together.

IST is not necessarily an alternative to other training methods, but may be used in conjunction with them. For instance, a [[Gamification Training|gamified approach]] maybe used to train a particular sub-portion of the network by 'mocking' the input and generating an expected output.
