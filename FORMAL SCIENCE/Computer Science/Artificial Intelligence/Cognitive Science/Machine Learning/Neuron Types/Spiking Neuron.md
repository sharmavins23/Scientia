The spiking [[Neuron (Computer Science)|neuron]] is a neuron that aims to more closely relate to its [[Neuron|biological counterpart]] by mimicking its time-variant behavior. Rather than summing integral or floating-point inputs, the spiking neuron will only transmit information when a [[Action Potential|membrane potential]] reaches a threshold value.

A fundamental question for implementation is whether spiking neurons can be temporally encoded (temporal neurons) or rate-encoded (spiking neurons). These are very technically similar in concept, but interestingly, [[Temporal Coding|temporal coding]] infers that a temporally encoded neuron may be able to replace several hundred [[Artificial Neuron|artificial neurons]].
