An LSM is a type of [[Reservoir Computing|reservoir computer]] that uses an [[Spiking Neural Network (SNN)|SNN]]. An LSM's [[Graph (Network)|graph]] consists of a variety of nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other, and the [[Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)|recurrent]] nature of the connections turns the time-varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network's nodes. These patterns are read out by [[linear discriminant]] units.
