A neural network in [[Machine Learning|ML]] is an umbrella term for ML models built using (extremely rudimentary) principles of neuronal organization. These designs, using statistical properties, may exhibit 'learning' properties.

ANNs are constructed out of [[Neuron (Computer Science)|neurons]], which are the fundamental computational unit.
