A CNN is a type of [[Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)|feedforward]] [[Artificial Neural Network (ANN)|ANN]] that learns features by itself via kernel optimization. They are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant ANNs (SIANNs).

Importantly, ANNs can extract the same number of features that CNNs can; The convolutional step allows for significantly fewer neurons, allowing for much larger networks with far more complicated feature inputs.
