A quantum computer is a computer that exploits properties of [[quantum mechanics]] in order to compute. Unlike traditional [[Von Neumann Architecture|Von Neumann]] architectures, quantum computers do not compute with simplistic logic gates. 

Quantum computers utilize [[qubits]], which are stores of data in superpositions.
