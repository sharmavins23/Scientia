In [[Financial Economics|finance]], a bond is a type of security in which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged (depending on the terms) to provide cash flow to the creditor (repay the principal) of the bond at the maturity date, as well as the interest. Generally, bonds are referencing U.S. Treasury Bonds, in where an investor loans the U.S. Government money and gains a fixed interest rate over a fixed period of time.

Notably, the treasury bond historically does not outperform the market, nor does it ever outperform the market on longer time scales. However, during particularly bullish runs, treasury bonds may outperform the losses incurred by the market. When stock prices rise and more people are buying to capitalize on that growth, demand for bonds decreases, and bond prices fall. Conve
