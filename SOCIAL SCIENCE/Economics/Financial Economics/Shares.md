In [[Financial Economics|financial markets]], shares are units of equity ownership in the capital stock of a corporation, and can refer to units of [[Mutual Fund|mutual funds]], partnerships, or real estate investment trusts.

The owner of shares in a company is a shareholder of the corporation. The total number of shares, or the dollar equivalent, is called the share capital.

## Long and Short

Generally, buying shares is considered a "long" position, which refers to a position where you are entitled to a security in your brokerage account. Buying rights to shares, or [[Options|options]], also puts you in a long position. Long positions are generally not very risky - You may only lose what you invested.

One may also sell positions they do not own, and be placed in "short" positions. Short positions are written contracts, which may be exercised by the buyer at any point. In this event, you *must* purchase shares elsewhere to give in your position. As such, the risk for short positions is theoretically unlimited, as the stock may increase to ridiculous quantities.
