In [[Financial Economics|finance]], an option is a contract which conveys to its owner, the *holder*, the right, **but not the obligation,** to buy or sell a specific quantity of an [[Shares|underlying asset]] at a specified strike price on a specified date. Options are usually either European (as described previously), or American-style, where the buying/selling may be excised at a prior date.
