An astronomical object (also called celestial or stellar object, or heavenly body) is a naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure that exists within the [[Universe|observable universe]]. Notably, an astronomical 'object' is not the same as an astronomical 'body'. An astronomical body is a tightly connected structure, whereas a celestial *object* is a less cohesively bound structure (for instance, [[Saturn|Saturn]] and her ring consist of one body, but the ring is technically a separate object).
