The kuiper belt is an [[Asteroid|asteroid]] belt extending beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]] in our [[Solar System]], approximately 30 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] to 50 AU away from the [[Sun]]. It is 20 times as wide and 200 times as massive as the [[Asteroid Belt|main asteroid belt]]. Most Kuiper belt objects are composed of frozen [[Volatile (Astrogeology)|volatiles]] (ices) such as [[Methane|methane]], [[Ammonia|ammonia]], and [[Water|water]]. The Kuiper belt is also home to the [[Dwarf Planet|dwarf planets]] [[Orcus]], [[Pluto]], [[Haumea]], [[Quaoar]], and [[Makemake]]. Some of the solar system's [[Natural Satellite|moons]], such as [[Neptune|Neptune's]] [[Triton]] and [[Saturn|Saturn's]] [[Phoebe]] may have originated in this region.
