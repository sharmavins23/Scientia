Theia is a hypothesized [[Mars]]-sized ancient [[Planet|planet]] in the early [[Solar System]] that, according to the giant-impact hypothesis, collided with the [[Earth]] [[Hadean Eon|4.5 billion years ago]] in order to form the [[Moon]]. There is evidence to support the hypothesis:

- The Moon's orbit has a similar orientation to Earth's spin.
- The Earth-Moon system contains anomalously high [[Angular Momentum|angular momentum]], and a giant impact may have supplied this momentum.
- Moon samples indicate the Moon was once [[Lunar Magma Ocean|molten]] to a substantial, but unknown, depth.
- The Moon has a relatively small [[Iron|iron]] [[Planetary Core|core]], which gives the Moon a lower [[Density|density]] than Earth. A Mars-sized object impacting with Earth would likely penetrate Earth and fuse with its core, leaving less [[Metal|metallic]] iron than other planetary bodies.
- The Moon is depleted in [[Volatile (Astrogeology)|volatile]] elements compared to the Earth, which could have been vaporized in a collision.
- Other star systems contain similar collision evidence, leaving [[Debris Disc|debris discs]].
- The [[Stable Isotope|stable isotope]] ratios of lunar and terrestrial [[Rock|rock]] are identical, implying a common origin.
