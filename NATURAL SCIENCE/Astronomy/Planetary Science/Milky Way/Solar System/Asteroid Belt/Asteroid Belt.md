The [[Asteroid|asteroid]] belt is a [[Torus|torus]]-shaped region in our [[Solar System]] centered around the sun and roughly spanning the free space between [[Jupiter]] and [[Mars]]. It contains a number of solid, irregularly-shaped asteroids. On average, these asteroids are one million kilometers apart. About 60% of the main belt's mass is contained in [[Ceres]], [[Vesta]], [[Pallas]], and [[Hygiea]].
