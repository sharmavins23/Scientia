In [[Planetary Science|planetary studies]], the Messier objects are a set of 110 [[Astronomical Object|celestial bodies]] catalogued by French astronomer Charles Messier in his *Catalogue des Nebuleuses et des Amas d'Etoiles (Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters)*. As Messier was only interested in finding comets, the *Messier Catalogue* became a list of non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt. The first edition of this list was published in 1774, and featured 45 objects.
