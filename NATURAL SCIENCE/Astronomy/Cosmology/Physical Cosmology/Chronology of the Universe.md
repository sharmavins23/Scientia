The chronology of the [[Universe|universe]] is a [[Physical Cosmology|model]] that describes the history, [[Expansion of the Universe|current state]], and [[Ultimate Fate of the Universe|potential future]] of the cosmos, according to the [[Big Bang|big bang cosmology]].

## The Very Early Universe

The first picosecond ($10^{-12} \text{ sec}$) of cosmic time encompasses the 'very early' universe.

This includes the [[Planck Unit|Planck]] epoch, where the current laws of [[Physics|physics]] may not have applied. During this time, the four [[Force|fundamental interactions]] appeared - First, [[Gravity|gravitational]]; Then the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[Strong Interaction|strong]], and [[Weak Interaction|weak]].

Finally, the inflationary epoch occurred, from roughly $10^{-36} \text{ sec}$ to $10^{-33} \text{ sec}$. For this small time period, space expanded exponentially and nonlinearly.

## The Early Universe

This period lasted 370,000 years.

During the first second, [[Neutrino|neutrinos]] decoupled and ceased interacting with [[Proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]] significantly. They formed the [[Cosmic Neutrino Background Radiation|CvB radiation]].

Around 2 minutes, roughly 25% of the formed protons and neutrons engaged in [[Nucelosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]], fusing into heavier elements such as [[Deuterium|deuterium]] and [[Helium-4|helium-4]].

By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for [[Nuclear Fusion|nuclear fusion]], but far too hot for neutral atoms to exist or photons to travel far. As such, it exists as an [[Opacity|opaque]] [[Plasma|plasma]].

Around 18,000 years, the recombination epoch begins, and electrons combine with these formed [[Helium|helium]] elements to form proper helium [[Ion|ions]].

At 47,000 years, the universe cools, and its behavior is dominated by matter rather than radiation.

At 100,000 years, after the neutral helium [[Atom|atoms]] form, [[Helium Hydride|helium hydride]] is generated as the first [[molecule|molecule]].

At 370,000 years, neutral [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] atoms finish forming, and the universe becomes [[Transparency|transparent]] for the first time. Hydrogen, helium, and [[Lithium|lithium]] atoms enter their lowest energy states by releasing [[Photon|photons]], making up [[Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation|CMB radiation]] that we can observe today.

## The Dark Ages

This period exists from 370,000 years to 1 billion years.

As clouds of recombined hydrogen only collapsed very slowly to form [[Star|stars]] and [[Galaxy|galaxies]], there were no new sources of [[Light|light]]. The only [[Photon|photons]] in the universe were those released from prior decoupling or recombination, or from [[21cm Radio Emission|21cm radio emissions]] emitted from hydrogen atoms.

After 3 million years, the pale orange light would gradually [[Redshift|redshift]] to non-visible wavelengths, turning the universe completely dark.

At some point between 200 million and 500 million years, the earliest generations of stars and galaxies form, drawn to the [[Dark Matter|dark matter]] [[Galaxy Filament|filaments]] throughout the universe. These earlier stars may have had shorter lifetimes, may have been huge (100 to 300 [[Solar Mass|solar masses]]), and may have been [[Metallicity|non-metallic]]. As these stars died in singular millions of years, their [[Supernova|supernovae]] created the majority of everyday [[Chemical Element|elements]].

Over time, [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]] and [[Supercluster|superclusters]] emerged.

## The Universe as it Appears Today

This period lasted from 1 billion years to the current day. It is estimated that the universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.

The universe (over this period) has looked fundamentally similar to how it does today - Not much has changed.

At roughly 5 billion years, the [[Thin Disk|thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] formed.

Roughly 5 or 6 billion years ago (so, 7 or 8 billion years), the universe passed an inflection point. The thinning of matter reduces the ability of gravity to contract the universe; In contrast, [[Dark Energy|dark energy]] tends to accelerate the universe. As such, it appears the universe has begun to [[Accelerating Expansion of the Universe|accelerate in its expansion]].

Around 9.2 billion years, our [[Solar System|solar system]] formed. At approximately 10.3 billion years, the earliest traces of life emerged.

## The Far Future

There are a variety of theories for the future and [[Ultimate Fate of the Universe|ultimate fate]] of the universe. However, at some point, the [[Stelliferous Era|stelliferous era]] will end, as stars will no longer be born, and the expansion of the universe will become limited to local galaxies.
