The temporal lobe is one of the four lobes of the [[Cerebrum|cerebrum]] and is sometimes (erroneously) referred to as the neocortex. On the brain, it is beneath the [[Sylvian fissure]] on both cerebral hemispheres.

The temporal lobe is responsible for processing sensory input into derived meanings for appropriate retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association. 'Temporal' refers to the head's temples.
