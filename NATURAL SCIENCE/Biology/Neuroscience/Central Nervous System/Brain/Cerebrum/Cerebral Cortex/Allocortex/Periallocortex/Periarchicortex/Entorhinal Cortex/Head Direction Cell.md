The head direction (HD) cell is a type of [[Neuron|neuron]] found in a vast variety of brain regions that increase firing rates above baseline levels when an animal's head points in a particular direction.

The HD cell is found in many brain areas, including the cortical regions of the [[postsubiculum|postsubiculum]], [[Retrosplenial cortex|retrosplenial cortex]], and [[Entorhinal Cortex|entorhinal cortex]], as well as in sub-cortical regions like the [[Thalamus|thalamus]], [[lateral mammillary nucleus|lateral mammillary nucleus]], [[dorsal tegmental nucleus|dorsal tegmental nucleus]], and [[corpus striatum|striatum]].

One striking characteristic of HD cells is that in *most* regions of the brain, they maintain the same relative preferred firing directions regardless of landmarks surrounding the animal. This suggests that the cells interact so as to maintain a stable 'heading' signal.

Alongside the [[Boundary Cell|boundary cell]], [[Grid Cell|grid cell]], [[Place Cell|place cell]], and [[Speed Cell|speed cell]], they form a larger set of [[Neuron|neurons]] involved in cognitive mapping of an environment.
