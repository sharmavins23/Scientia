The hippocampus proper refers to the *actual* structure of the hippocampus. Its subfields, labelled CA1 through CA3, use the initials of cornu Ammonis, the original name of the hippocampus.

## Structure

There are three individual 'subfields' (and one incorrectly named subfield, CA4, which is actually part of the [[Dentate Gyrus|dentate gyrus]]) of the hippocampus proper, which form a [[neural circuit|neural circuit]] called the [[Trisynaptic Circuit|trisynaptic circuit]].

### CA1

CA1 is often described as the final region in the hippocampal circuit, and contains an output pathway to layer V of the [[Entorhinal Cortex|Entorhinal Cortex]]. Another significant output is towards the [[subiculum]].

### CA2

CA2 is located between CA1 and CA3, receiving some input from layer II of the entorhinal cortex via the [[perforant path|perforant path]].

### CA3

CA3 receives input from mossy fibers of the [[granule cells|granule cells]] in the dentate gyrus, as well as from cells in the entorhinal cortex (again via the perforant path). This mossy fiber path ends in the [[stratum lucidum|stratum lucidum]].

Inputs to CA3 also come from the [[medial septum|medial septum]] and from the [[diagonal band of Broca|diagonal band of Broca]].

CA3 has been observed to be the 'pacemaker' of the hippocampus, generating most of the oscillatory behavior.
