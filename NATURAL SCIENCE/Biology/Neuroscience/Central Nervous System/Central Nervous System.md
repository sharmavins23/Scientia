The central nervous system consists of the [[Brain|brain]] and the [[Spinal Cord|spinal cord]], and makes up the majority of sensorimotor processing in an animal.

## Organization

The [[Nematode|nematode]] [[Caenorhabditis elegans|Caenorhabditis elegans]] has been completely visualized in its nervous system. When viewed under a [[Graph Theory|graphical lens]], its structure forms a [[Watts-Strogatz 'Small-World' Model|small-world.]] ([The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans - White, Southgate, Thomson, Brenner](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22462104/)).

Other studies of cellular networks in mammalian neocortices reveal a highly non-random feature, including a tendency for [[Synapse|synaptic]] connections to be reciprocal and clustered ([Complex Brain Networks: Graph Theoretical Analysis of Structural and Functional Systems - Bullmore, Sporns](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2575)).
