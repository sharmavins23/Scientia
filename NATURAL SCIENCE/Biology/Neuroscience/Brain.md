The brain is the [[organ]] that sits as the center of the [[nervous system]] in most animals. Generally, it is positioned close to the organs for the senses, especially those of vision.

Locations of components are described on an axis basis. There are three axes, best described in reference to a rat or other four-legged animal:

- Rostral-caudal, the axis going from the nose to the tail (in a rat). This axis sits perpendicular to the coronal plane.
- Dorsal-ventral, the axis going from the dorsal fin to the ventral/pelvic fin (in a fish). This axis sits perpendicular to the horizontal plane.
- Medial-lateral, the axis going from the left to right ear. This axis sits perpendicular to the sagittal plane.

The brain is made up of the following seven major components:

1. The [[Spinal Cord|spinal cord]], which is the farthest caudal; It receives and processes sensory information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the limbs and trunk and controls movement. It connects to the [[brain stem]].
2. The [[medulla oblongata]] includes centers for digestion, breathing, and control of heart rate.
3. The [[pons]] conveys information about movement from the cerebral hemispheres to the cerebellum.
4. The [[cerebellum]] modulates force and range of movement, and is involved in the learning of motor skills to some degree. It's functionally connected to the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain.
5. The [[midbrain]] controls sensory and motor functions, including eye movement and coordination of visual and auditory reflexes.
6. The [[diencephalon]] contains two structures, acting as a mid-layer between the cerebral cortex and the the remainder of the central [[nervous system]].
7. The [[Cerebrum|cerebrum]] comprises two cerebral hemispheres, each consisting of an outer layer and three deeper structures.
