Neurons, or nerve [[cell|cells]], are specialized cells that make up the building blocks of the [[nervous system]], including the brain and the spinal cord.

The neuron is the main component of [[nervous tissue]] in all animals except sponges and [[placozoa]]. Non-animals like plants and fungi do not contain neurons.

Neurons are typically generated by [[neural stem cells]] during brain development and childhood in a process known as [[neurogenesis]], which largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.

## Types of Neurons

There are three types of neurons:

1. [[Sensory neurons]] respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the [[sensory organs]]. They send signals to the [[spinal cord]] or [[brain]].
2. [[Motor neurons]] receive signals form the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output.
3. [[Interneurons]] connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.

Multiple neurons functionally connected together form a [[neural circuit]].

The neuron is made up of a series of individual parts:

- The [[Soma|soma]], or the body of the neuron.
- The [[Dendrites|dendrites]], or the tree-like branching growths. These are inputs to the cell.
- The [[Axon|axon]], or output from the cell. It is orders of magnitude longer than the diameter of the soma.
- The [[Plasma Membrane|plasma membrane]] is a covering for the neuron cell.
