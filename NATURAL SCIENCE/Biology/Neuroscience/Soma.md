The soma (or perikaryon/neurocyton) is the cell body of the neuron, and contains the [[nucleus]] as well as most of the [[cell]]'s [[organelles]], such as the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[golgi apparatus]].

The soma is not responsible for any input or output to the cell. As such, it is often referred to as the 'non-process' portion of the cell, and is instead responsible for survival and production of the cell.

## Nucleus

The nucleus of the neuron is the source of most of the [[Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)|Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)]] within the cell. This RNA acts as messages passed throughout the cell, or genetic information. On top of maintenance for the cell, this RNA can also be used to trigger synaptic plasticity changes (such as in the weights).

## Nissl Granules

Separate Nissl granules (or Nissl bodies, Nissl substances, or Tigroid substances) exist within the soma. They consist of [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] masses, and are thought to have the same function - The synthesis and segregation of proteins for intra-cellular use.
