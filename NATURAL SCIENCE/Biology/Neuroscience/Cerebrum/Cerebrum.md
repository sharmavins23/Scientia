The cerebrum is made up of two cerebral hemispheres, the left and right halves of the brain. It contains a heavily wrinkled outer layer, the [[Cerebral Cortex|cerebral cortex]], as well as three deeper structures:

- The [[basal ganglia]], which regulates movement execution and motor- and habit-learning, which is referred to as [[implicit memory]];
- The [[hippocampus]], which is critical for the storage of memory of people, places, things, and events; Also known as [[explicit memory]];
- And the [[amygdaloid nuclei]], which coordinates autonomic and endocrine responses of emotional states, including memory of threats. This is another form of [[implicit memory]].
