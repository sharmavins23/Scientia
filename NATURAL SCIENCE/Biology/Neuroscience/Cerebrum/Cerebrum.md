The cerebrum is made up of two cerebral hemispheres, the left and right halves of the brain. It contains a heavily wrinkled outer layer, the [[Cerebral Cortex|cerebral cortex]], as well as three deeper structures:

- The [[basal ganglia]], which regulates movement execution and motor- and habit-learning, which is referred to as [[implicit memory]];
- The [[Hippocampus (Archicortex)|hippocampus]], which is critical for the storage of memory of people, places, things, and events. It exists within the temporal lobe. Also known as [[explicit memory]];
- And the [[amygdaloid nuclei]], which coordinates autonomic and endocrine responses of emotional states, including memory of threats. This is another form of [[implicit memory]].

## Lobes

The cerebrum is divided into the following regions: [[Frontal Lobe|frontal]], [[Occipital Lobe|occipital]], [[Parietal Lobe|parietal]], and [[Temporal Lobe|temporal]]. These portions perform different functions, and are strongly correlated with doing so - Damage to the frontal lobe incurs loss of speech and motor function. Damage to the occipital lobe incurs loss of vision.
