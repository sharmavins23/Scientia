The place cell is a type of [[Pyramidal Cells|pyramidal cell]] within the [[Hippocampus (Archicortex)|hippocampus]] that activates when an animal enters a particular place within the environment, known as a 'place field.' Alongside the [[Boundary Cell|boundary cell]], [[Grid Cell|grid cell]], [[Head Direction Cell|head direction cell]], and [[Speed Cell|speed cell]], they form a larger set of [[Neuron|neurons]] involved in cognitive mapping of an environment.

Place cells are thought to play an important role in episodic memory, containing information about the spatial context a memory took place in. They also seem to exhibit 'replay', consolidating place-based information by reactivating in a particular order at a faster timescale. Finally, place cells are also thought to work collectively to form a 'cognitive mapping' of a particular location.

## Place Fields

Place cells tend to fire in specific regions of an environment, which are named place fields. Conceptually, in a particular 'room', every place cell may have a particular square (or maybe even cubic volume) area acting as a 'place field' for the cell. Unlike [[Sensory neurons|sensory neurons]]' receptive fields, place cells show no topography, so two neighboring cells may not necessarily have adjacent place fields.

Place cells fire spikes in rapid bursts within a particular place field, but outside they remain relatively inactive. Place fields are allocentric, and are *not* relative to the body; Furthermore, place cells may show directionality, indicating they will only fire in a certain location when also travelling in a particular direction.

## Remapping

Place cells have been known (from time to time) to suddenly change their firing pattern from one pattern to another, in a process known as remapping. This may occur in some place cells or all place cells at once.

## Sensory Input

Place cells are largely unaffected by large sensory changes, such as removing landmarks from an environment, but instead respond to subtle changes often, such as the changing of color or shape of a particular object. This suggests that place fields do not take direct sensory input from their environment but instead respond to complex stimuli.
