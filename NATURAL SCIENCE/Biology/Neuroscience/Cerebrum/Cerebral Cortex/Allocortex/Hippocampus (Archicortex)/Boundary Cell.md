A boundary cell, also known as a border cell or boundary vector cell, is a [[Neuron|neuron]] found in the [[Hippocampus (Archicortex)|hippocampal formation]]. It responds to the presence of an environmental boundary at a particular distance and direction from an animal. In particular, they tend to fire more readily in response to decreasing the magnitude of the vector between the animal and a boundary in its environment (hence, boundary vector cell).

Boundary cells have been discovered within the [[subiculum|subiculum]], [[Presubiculum|presubiculum]], and [[Entorhinal Cortex|entorhinal cortex]]. Alongside the [[Grid Cell|grid cell]], [[Head Direction Cell|head direction cell]], [[Place Cell|place cell]], and [[Speed Cell|speed cell]], they form a larger set of [[Neuron|neurons]] involved in cognitive mapping of an environment.
