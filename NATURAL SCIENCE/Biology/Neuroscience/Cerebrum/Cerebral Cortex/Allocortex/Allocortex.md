The allocortex, or heterogenetic cortex, is one of the two types of [[Cerebral Cortex|cerebral cortex]] within the brain. It takes up roughly 10% of the brain's cortex by area. In contrast to the [[Neocortex|neocortex]], the allocortex contains three or four cortical layers.

## Subtypes

The allocortex is divided into the following subtypes:

- The [[paleocortex|paleocortex]] contains the [[olfactory bulb]], [[olfactory tubercle]] and [[piriform cortex]]. It contains three cortical laminae, or layers of [[Soma|neuronal cell bodies]].
- The [[Hippocampus (Archicortex)|archicortex]] is synonymous with the hippocampus. It contains four layers of [[Soma|neuronal cell bodies]].
- The [[periallocortex|periallocortex]] is a transitional layer between the neocortex and the paleo/archicortex. As such, it is divided into two particular types.

Because the number of cortical laminae seem to be directly proportional to the information-processing capabilities of that tissue, as well as its [[phylogenetic age|phylogenetic age]], the paleocortex is thought to be the most primitive form of cortex.
