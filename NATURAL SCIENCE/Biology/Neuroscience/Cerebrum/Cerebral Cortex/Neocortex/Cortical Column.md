A cortical column is a large thin portion of the [[Neocortex|neocortex]]. It is thought to be the primary building block of the neocortex.

Physically, the cortical column is thought to be a small needle-like structure. Unfolding the neocortex, the cortical column would be roughly one square millimeter in cross-sectional area, and extends throughout the entire 2.5mm thickness, for a total of 2.5 cubic millimeters.

There are (supposedly) roughly 150,000 cortical columns stacked side-by-side in the neocortex. This size varies for different animals; For mice and rats, there is one cortical column for each whisker, about half a millimeter in diameter each. For cats, vision columns appear to be one millimeter in diameter.

All cells in one column respond to a particular sensory input. For instance, one column will respond to a patch of skin; Another may respond for a particular part of the retina. This grouping of responses is what defines the column, and what clues us into their existence.

Cortical columns are thought to not be physically distinct from one another; Rather, it is what they are *attached to* that governs their functionality. They are made up of [[minicolumns]].
