A tripartite [[Synapse|synapse]] usually refers to the functional integration occurring between the presynaptic [[Axon|axon]], the postsynaptic [[Dendrite|dendritic segments]], and the [[Neuroglia|neuroglia]] facilitating this transfer.

Tripartite synapses are popular models for modelling inhibitory responses within the brain. As such, they are also utilized in [[Machine Learning|ML]] applications.
