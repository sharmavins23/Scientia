Neuroglia (also called glial cells, glia, or gliocytes) are non-neuronal [[Cell|cells]] within the [[nervous system]]. They do not produce electrical impulses, and make up more than half of the volume of neural tissue within the body.

Neuroglia maintain [[homeostasis]], form [[myelin]] in the peripheral nervous system, and provide support and protection for [[Neuron|neurons]]. They also surround neurons and hold them in place, insulating them electrically, destroy pathogens and dead neurons, and supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons.

## Types

In the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system]], glial cells include the following:

- [[oligodendrocyte|Oligodendrocytes]],
- [[astrocyte|Astrocytes]],
- [[Ependymal cells|Ependymal cells]],
- [[Microglia|Microglia]].

In the [[peripheral nervous system]], glial cells include the following:

- [[Schwann cells|Schwann cells]],
- [[Satellite cells|Satellite cells]].
