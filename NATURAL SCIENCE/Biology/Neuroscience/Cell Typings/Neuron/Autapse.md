An autapse is a special kind of [[Synapse|synapse]] where the [[Axon|axon]] directly connects to its own [[Dendrites|dendrites]]. Autapses have been found within the dog and rat [[Cerebral Cortex|cerebral cortex]], monkey [[neostriatum]], and the cat [[Spinal Cord|spinal cord]]. Autapses are relatively rare *in vivo*, but are fairly common *in vitro* cell cultures.

Like synapses, autapses may be chemical or electrical; They may also be [[Glutamate (Neurotransmitter)|excitatory]] or [[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)|inhibitory]].

Autapses have been one of the foundational supporting biological motivations for [[Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)|recurrent neural networks]]. Despite this, autapses in biology have stranger formations - [Recent research](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2017/5436737/) suggests that autaptic loops form as a result of neuronal signal transmission blockage, where autaptic loops are developed to remediate signal transmission.
