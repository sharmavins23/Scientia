A synapse is a structure permitting a neuron to pass electrical or chemical signals to other neurons. 

(usually) a connection point between a *pre-synaptic* neuron's [[Axon|axon]] and a *post-synaptic* neuron's [[Dendrites|dendrite]].

Contrary to prior belief, synapses are found (in many parts of the brain) to be created and destroyed consistently. Learning is thought to occur within these synaptic connections; Things that are forgotten represent synapses disappearing.

There are differing kinds of synapses: Chemical and electrical.
