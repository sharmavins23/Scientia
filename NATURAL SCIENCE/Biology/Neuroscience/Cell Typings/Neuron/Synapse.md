A synapse is a structure permitting a neuron to pass electrical or chemical signals to other neurons. They are (usually) a connection point between a *pre-synaptic* neuron's [[Axon|axon]] and a *post-synaptic* neuron's [[Dendrites|dendrite]].

Contrary to prior belief, synapses are found (in many parts of the brain) to be created and destroyed consistently. Learning is thought to occur within these synaptic connections; Things that are forgotten represent synapses disappearing.

There are differing kinds of synapses - Chemical and electrical. They can also be [[Glutamate (Neurotransmitter)|excitatory]] or [[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)|inhibitory]]. Synapses utilize [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] in order to communicate.
