The axon, or nerve fiber/fibre, is a long, slender projection of a [[Neuron|neuron]] in vertebrates that typically conducts [[Action Potential|electrical impulses]] away from the nerve cell body. It is connected to the neuron at the [[Axon Hillock|Axon Hillock]].

Unlike their counterpart, the axon is considered a neuronal output; It sends electrical signals away from the pre-[[Synapse|synaptic]] neuron and towards the synapse, where it enters the post-synaptic cell.

## Groups of Nerve Fibers

Most nerve fibers are encased in [[Myelin|myelin]] (and are called 'myelinated'), which insulates axons and increases the rate at which electrical impulses are passed along. However, some axons are not.

Axons are classed into three types - A, B, and C. Group C nerve fibers are unmyelinated. This means that they are not insulated and their signals travel slower. Group C axons also are grouped together into Remak bundles.
