Neurons, or nerve [[Cell|cells]], are specialized cells that make up the building blocks of the [[Nervous System|nervous system]], including the brain and the spinal cord.

The neuron is the main component of [[nervous tissue]] in all animals except sponges and [[placozoa]]. Non-animals like plants and fungi do not contain neurons.

Neurons are typically generated by [[Neural Stem Cell|neural stem cells]] during brain development and childhood in a process known as [[neurogenesis]], which largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.

Neurons communicate with each other through both electrical and chemical signals. These chemical signals, or proteins, are [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]]. Some neurons may also communicate through [[gap junctions]], affecting others' electrical properties directly. Neurons are also thought to communicate via [[mRNA]].

## Types of Neurons

There are three types of neurons:

1. [[Sensory neurons]] respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the [[sensory organs]]. They send signals to the [[Spinal Cord|spinal cord]] or remainder of the brain.
2. [[Motor neurons]] receive signals form the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output.
3. [[Interneurons]] connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.

Multiple neurons functionally connected together form a [[neural circuit]].

## Makeup

The neuron is made up of a series of individual parts:

- The [[Soma|soma]], or the body of the neuron.
- The [[Dendrite|dendrites]], or the tree-like branching growths. These are inputs to the cell.
- The [[Axon|axon]], or output from the cell. It is orders of magnitude longer than the diameter of the soma.
- The [[Plasma Membrane|plasma membrane]] is a covering for the neuron cell.

## Connectivity

It has been suggested ([Wiring Optimization in Cortical Circuits - Chklovskii, Schikorski, Stevens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11988166/)) that the spatial layout of neurons is arranged to minimize the axonal volume and reduce axon size throughout evolution. This is further seen through [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging|fMRI]] studies of functional neuron activity through age-variant studies - Older age groups show stronger signs of small-world properties with significantly reduced cost efficiency and significantly greater redundancy ([Complex Brain Networks: Graph Theoretical Analysis of Structural and Functional Systems - Bullmore, Sporns](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2575)).
