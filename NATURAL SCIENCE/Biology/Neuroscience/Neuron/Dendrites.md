A dendrite is a branching structure from the neuron that propagates electro-chemical stimulation from other nerve cells into the [[Soma|soma]] of the neuron. In this way, a dendrite is strictly an input. The dendrites themselves also perform the role of [[Neuronal Integration|integration]].

The dendrites project out from the soma, and usually receive input from the axon of other neurons. This connection point is a [[synapse]], and synapses may either be axodendritic (connections between axon and dendrite) or in some cases dendrodendritic (between two dendrites). An [[autapse]] can also form, where the dendrite listens to its own axon. Autaptic connections are, relatively speaking, uncommon.

## Types

There are different unique types of neurons based on their configurations of axon and dendrite.

- [[Multipolar neurons]] are composed of one axon and many dendritic trees.
	- [[Pyramidal cells]] are multipolar cortical neurons with pyramid-shaped cell bodies and large [[apical dendrites]] that extend to the surface of the cortex.
- [[Bipolar neurons]] have one axon and one dendritic tree at opposing ends of the cell body.
- [[Unipolar neurons]] have a stalk extending to the cell body that separates into two branches, with one containing dendrites and the other with terminal buttons. These buttons are used to detect sensory stimuli.
