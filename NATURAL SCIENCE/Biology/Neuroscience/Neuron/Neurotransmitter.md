A neurotransmitter is a type of signalling [[molecule]] secreted by a [[Neuron|neuron]] to affect another cell across a [[Synapse|synapse]]. The receiving cell may be another neuron or potentially a [[gland]] or [[muscle cell]].

Common neurotransmitters in the brain include [[glutamate]], [[GABA]], [[acetylcholine]], [[glycine]], and [[norepinephrine]].

## Mechanism

### Synthesis

Neurotransmitters are generally synthesized within the [[Soma|cell body]] (though smaller molecules are made within the pre-synaptic terminal) and are made up of, or derived from, precursor molecules that are found abundantly in the cell. There are a series of classes of neurotransmitters that are synthesized:

- [[Amino Acid|Amino acid]] neurotransmitters such as [[glycine]] and [[glutamate]];
- [[Monoamine|Monoamines]] such as [[serotonin]], [[epinephrine]], and [[dopamine]];
- [[Peptide|Peptides]] such as [[substance P]] or [[opioid|opioids]];
- [[Purine|Purines]] such as [[ATP]] or [[GTP]];
- Other neurotransmitters such as [[nitric oxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]].

### Storage

Neurotransmitters are generally stored in [[synaptic vesicles]], clustered close to the [[Plasma Membrane|cell membrane]] at the [[Axon|axon]] terminal of the pre-synaptic neuron. Some neurotransmitters, such as the metabolic gases (CO, NO) are synthesized and immediately released without being stored.

### Release

Neurotransmitters are released in response to an electrical signal called an [[Action Potential|action potential]], binding to particular receptors on the membrane of the post-synaptic neuron.

### Receptor Interaction

After being released, neurotransmitters will interact with receptors on the target cell. The effect of the neurotransmitter is thusly solely dependent on the identity of the target cell's receptors present at the synapse; Depending on the receptor, the neurotransmitter may cause [[excitation]], [[inhibition]], or modulation of the post-synaptic neuron.

### Elimination

In order to ensure the
