In [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiology]], summation (including both spatial and temporal) is the process determining whether an [[Action Potential|action potential]] will be generated. Summation is a combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals.

Many [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] models utilize summation concepts for their [[Activation Function|activation functions]].

## Spatial Summation

Spatial summation refers to the summation of multiple inputs from multiple pre-synaptic cells to one post-synaptic cell. Obviously, more pre-synaptic cells firing increase the probability of a post-synaptic cell reaching threshold and firing; More *inhibitory* post-synaptic cell firings prevent the cell from achieving an action potential.

The closer the [[Dendrite|dendritic input]] is to the [[Axon Hillock|axon hillock]], the more the potential influences the probability of the firing of an action potential in the post-synaptic cell. The ML analogue for this is 'weight.'

## Temporal Summation

Temporal summation occurs when high frequency of firing (of a particular pre-synaptic neuron) induces a firing in the post-synaptic neuron. Generally, the duration of the post-synaptic potential is noticeably longer than the interval between incoming action potentials. Amplitudes of post-synaptic potentials also seemingly [[Addition|algebraically summate]], generating a larger potential than individual potentials.
