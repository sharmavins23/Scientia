[[Cell|Cellular]] division is the process in which a cell splits up in order to reproduce. This may occur in two ways:

- Mitosis, or vegetative division, produces daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.
- Meiosis, or sexual division, produces [[haploid gametes]] for sexual reproduction. In this, the number of [[Chromosome|chromosomes]] is decreased from two of each type in the parent cell to one in each child.
