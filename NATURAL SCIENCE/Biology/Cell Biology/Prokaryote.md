A prokaryotic [[Cell|cell]], or prokaryote, is a single-celled organism lacking a [[Cell Nucleus|cell nucleus]] and other membrane-bound [[Organelle|organelles]]. Prokaryotes are divided into two particular domains: [[Bacteria|Bacteria]] and [[Archaea|archaea]].

Prokaryotes contain the following [[Organelle|organelles]]:

- [[Ribosome|Ribosomes]] are large complexes of [[Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)|RNA]] and [[Protein|protein]] molecules.
