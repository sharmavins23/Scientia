Eukaryotic [[Cell|cells]], or eukaryotes, are cells that contain a [[Cell Nucleus|cell nucleus]]. All [[animals]], [[plants]], [[fungi]], and many [[unicellular organisms]] are all eukaryotic.

Eukaryotic cells have more [[Organelle|organelles]] than their [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] counterparts. The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of eukaryotic organelles:

- The [[Cell Nucleus|cell nucleus]] is the cell's information center. It is the defining feature of the cell.
- The [[Mitochondria|mitochondria]] is the powerhouse of the [[Cell|cell]] and is responsible for providing energy for the cell's function.
- In plants only, [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] aid in the task of creating [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] through [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]].
- The [[endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] is a transport network for molecules.
- The [[golgi apparatus|golgi apparatus]] processes and packages [[Protein|proteins]] and [[Lipid|lipids]] synthesized by the cell.
- [[Lysosome|Lysosomes]] contain [[Digestive Enzyme|digestive enzymes]] and can digest excess or worn-out [[Organelle|organelles]], food particles, and any [[Virus|viruses]] or [[Bacteria|bacteria]].
- [[Peroxisome|Peroxisomes]] contain [[enzymes]] that rid the cell of toxic [[Peroxide|peroxides]].
- The [[Centrosome|centrosome]] produces the [[Microtubule|microtubules]] of the cell.
- [[Vacuole|Vacuoles]] sequester waste products and store water in plant cells.
- [[Ribosome|Ribosomes]] are large complexes of [[Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)|RNA]] and [[Protein|protein]] molecules.
- [[Plastid|Plastids]] contain pigments, influencing the color of an organism.
