The cell is the basic structural unit of all forms of life. Every cell (without exception) contains [[cytoplasm]] enclosed within a [[Plasma Membrane|membrane]], and contains many macromolecules such as [[Protein|proteins]], [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)|DNA]] and [[Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)|RNA]], as well as smaller molecules of nutrients and [[metabolite|metabolites]].

Cells fall into two particular types: [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]]. However, all cells (despite type) have a [[Plasma Membrane|cell membrane]], [[cytoskeleton]], genetic material, and [[Organelle|organelles]].

Cells may undergo [[Cellular Division|cellular division]] in order to reproduce.
