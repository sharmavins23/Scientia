In [[Developmental Biology|developmental biology]], the stem [[Cell|cell]] is an [[Stem Cell#Differentiation|undifferentiated]] or partially differentiated cell that can further differentiate into various types of cells in order to **infinitely** produce more cells. In a cell's lineage, they are the earliest type of cell.

Stem cells are found in both [[embryo|embryonic]] and adult organisms, but perform different roles in each.

## Self-renewal

In order to ensure the number of stem cells never shrinks in size, stem cells apply two mechanisms:

1. Asymmetric [[Cellular Division|cellular division]]: A stem cell divides into another undifferentiated stem cell, as well as another differentiated 'daughter' cell.
2. Stochastic differentiation: When a stem cell grows and divides into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell will undergo [[Cellular Division|mitosis]] and produce two identical stem cells.

## Differentiation

Stem cells may 'differentiate', or convert from a stem cell into a more 'particular' type of cell. Differentiation may happen multiple times, and is not to be confused with [[Cellular Division|cellular division]].

With a few exception, differentiation almost never involves a change in the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)|DNA]]; Instead, metabolic composition gets altered dramatically.

## Potency

Potency refers to the cell's potential to differentiate to other cells.

- Totipotent, or omnipotent stem cells may differentiate into embryonic or extra-embryonic cells, and are able to construct a complete and *viable* organism. These cells are produced from the fusion of an egg and sperm cell.
- Pluripotent stem cells are descendants of totipotent cells and may differentiate into nearly all cells.
- Multipotent stem cells may differentiate into a number of cell types, but only those of a close related family of cells.
- Oligopotent stem cells may only differentiate into a few types of cells, such as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.
- Unipotent stem cells may only produce one cell type, but can 'wait' to do so.
