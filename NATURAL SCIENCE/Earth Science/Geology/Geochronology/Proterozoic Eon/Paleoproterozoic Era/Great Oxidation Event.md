The Great Oxidation Event, also known as the [[Oxygen]] Catastrophe, Oxygen Revolution, Oxygen Crisis, or Oxygen Holocaust, was a time during the early [[Earth|Earth's]] [[Paleoproterozoic Era]] when the [[Atmosphere|atmosphere]] experienced a rise in the concentration of oxygen. This started around [[Siderian Period|2426 Mya]] and ended at approximately [[Rhyacian Period|2060 Mya]].

Oxygen reacted with [[Methane|methane]] in the atmosphere to form [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] and [[Water|water vapor]], greatly reducing the efficacy of the [[Greenhouse Effect|greenhouse effect]]. This caused an [[Icehouse Effect|icehouse effect]] and subsequent [[Ice Age|ice ages]], compounded by reduced [[Geothermal Activity|geothermal activities]] from low solar irradiation. This caused an [[Extinction Event|extinction]] wiping out the majority of [[Anaerobic Organism|anaerobic]] [[Microbial Mat|microbial mats]] on the Earth's surface and in shallow seas.
