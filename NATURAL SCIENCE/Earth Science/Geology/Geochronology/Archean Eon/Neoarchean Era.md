The Neoarchean Era is the final era in the [[Archean Eon]] spanning from 2800 to 2500 Mya. [[Cyanobacteria]] evolved [[Photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]], so [[Oxygen|oxygen]] rose in the [[Atmosphere|atmosphere]]. [[Soil]] compositions also encouraged [[Microorganism|microbial metabolisms]] to evolve, and the first [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic microbes]] appeared on land. [[Meteorite|Meteorites]] or [[Comet|comets]] may have also carried pre-biotic [[Organic Molecule|organic molecules]] to the [[Earth]].

[[Magma|Magmatic]] [[Rock|rocks]] containing an abundance of [[Phosphorus|phosphorus]] allowed oxygenic photosynthesis to occur in larger quantity. At the same time, the [[Supercontinent|supercontinent]] [[Kenorland]] formed. The first evidence of microbial oxidation of [[Sulfur|sulphur]] was found around 2520 Mya.
