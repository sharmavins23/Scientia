The Paleoarchean Era is a geologic era within the [[Archean Eon]]. It spans the period of time from 3600 Mya to 3200 Mya. The earliest *confirmed* evidence of [[Life|life]] comes from this era, and [[Vaalbara]], one of [[Earth|Earth's]] earliest [[Supercontinent|supercontinents]] may have formed during this era.

Most of Earth is still underwater, and its days are shorter (due to the Earth's rotation being faster earlier). Due to [[Deformation|deformation]] and [[Metamorphism|metamorphism]], most rocks do not provide useful information. However, the [[Dresser Formation]] within the [[Pilbara Craton]] contains [[Stromatolite|stromatolites]] once formed by [[Microbial Mat|microbial mats]], providing definite evidence of life. It is possible these stromatolites were instead formed through evaporitic [[Rain|precipitation]] and deposited on the sea floor, rendering them [[Abiogenic|abiogenic]].
