The Hadean eon is the oldest of the four known eons of [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]]. The eon started with the planet's formation approximately 4.54 billion years ago. The eon was named after the [[Greek|Ancient Greek]] god [[Hades]], describing the [[Hell|hellish]] conditions prevailing on the [[Earth]], being a sea of [[Lava|lava]] due to its recent [[Accretion|accretion]] and frequent collisions. The term 'Priscoan Period' (from the Latin *priscus*, or 'ancient') was also used, and older texts refer to this eon as the Pre-Archean eon.

The [[Theia|moon was formed]] early in this eon (approximately 4.5 billion years ago). The majority of the [[Atmosphere|atmosphere]] is [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]], but studies of [[Zircon|zircons]] find that [[Liquid|liquid]] [[Water|water]] [[Ocean|oceans]] may have existed between 4.0 and 4.4 billion years ago. Despite the high surface [[Temperature|temperature]], at an atmospheric [[Pressure|pressure]] of 27 ATM, water remains liquid.

[[Geology|Geological]] records from 3.2 billion years ago contains evidence of multiple impacts of objects up to 100 km in diameter. Each impact would have boiled off up to 100 m of a global ocean, and temporarily raised the atmospheric temperature to 500 celsius.
