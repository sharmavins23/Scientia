In [[Physics|physics]], electromagnetism is an interaction that occurs between [[Particle|particles]] with [[Electric Charge|charge]] via [[Electromagnetic Field|EM fields]]. The EM force is one of the fundamental [[Force|forces]] in nature, and is the dominant force in the interactions of [[Atom|atoms]] and [[molecule|molecules]]. It can be thought of as a combination of [[Electrostatics|electrostatics]] and [[Magnetism|magnetism]], which are two distinct yet closely intertwined phenomena.
