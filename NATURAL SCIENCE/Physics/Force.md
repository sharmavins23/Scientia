In [[Physics|physics]], the fundamental interactions, or forces, are a set of four([[Quintessence|?]]) interactions that cannot be reduced to more basic interactions. Any other forces are derived off these four. The four forces are:

- [[Gravity|Gravity]];
- [[Electromagnetism|The electromagnetic force]];
- [[Weak Interaction|The weak force]];
- [[Strong Interaction|The strong force]].

All forces may be described mathematically as [[Field|fields]].
