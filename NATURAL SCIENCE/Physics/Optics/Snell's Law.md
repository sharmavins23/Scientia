Snell's law (also known as the Snell-Descartes law, the ibn-Sahl law, and the law of [[Refraction|refraction]]) is a [[Formula|formula]] designed to describe the relationship between angles of incidence and wave refraction.

$$
n_1 \sin{\theta_1} = n_2 \sin{\theta_2}
$$

For this, $n_1$ and $n_2$ refer to the incident and refracted index, where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ refer to the incident and refracted angles.
