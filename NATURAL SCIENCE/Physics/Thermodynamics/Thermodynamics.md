Thermodynamics is a [[Physics|physical]] branch of science dealing with [[Heat|heat]], [[Work (Thermodynamics)|work]], and [[Temperature|temperature]], as well as their relations to [[Energy|energy]], [[Entropy|entropy]], and the physical properties of [[Matter|matter]] and [[Radiation|radiation]].

Thermodynamics is namely governed by four laws:

0. If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
1. In a closed system, change in internal energy of the system $\Delta U_{system}$ is equal to the difference between the heat supplied to the system $Q$ and the work done $W$ by the system on its surroundings.
	1.   $$
   \Delta U_{system} = Q - W
   $$
