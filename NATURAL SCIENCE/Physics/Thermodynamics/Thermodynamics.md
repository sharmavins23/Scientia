Thermodynamics is a [[Physics|physical]] branch of science dealing with [[Heat|heat]], [[Work (Thermodynamics)|work]], and [[Temperature|temperature]], as well as their relations to [[Energy|energy]], [[Entropy|entropy]], and the physical properties of [[Matter|matter]] and [[Radiation|radiation]].

Thermodynamics is namely governed by four laws:

1. (Zeroeth Law) If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
2. (First Law) In a closed system, change in internal energy of the system $\Delta U_{system}$ is equal to the difference between the [[Heat|heat]] supplied to the system $Q$ and the [[Work (Thermodynamics)|work]] done $W$ by the system on its surroundings: $\Delta U_{system} = Q - W$.
	1. This law is a variant of the [[Law of Conservation of Energy|law of conservation of energy]] adapted for thermodynamic processes.
	2. The concept of energy is broken down into [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] $KE_{system}$, [[Potential Energy|potential energy]] $PE_{system}$, and internal energy $U_{system}$ such that $E_{total} = KE_{system} + PE_{system} + U_{system}$.
	3. When matter is transferred into a system, the internal and potential energy associated with said matter is transferred into the new system: $(u\Delta M)_{in} = \Delta U_{system}$.
	4. The flow of heat is a form of energy transfer.
3. (Second Law) When two initially isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium with itself but not necessarily with each other, are then allowed to interact, they will eventually reach a mutual thermodynamic equilibrium. The sum of the entropies of the initially isolated systems is less than or equal to the total entropy of the final combination. Equality occurs just when the two original systems have all their respective intensive variables equal; Then the final system also has the same values. $\delta Q = T \space dS$.
	1. The second law generically refers to the tendency of natural processes to lead towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy, especially that of temperature.
4. (Third Law) A system's entropy approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches [[Absolute Zero|absolute zero]]. $S = k_B \ln{\Omega}$.
	1. In the equation, $k_B$ refers to [[Boltzmann's Constant|Boltzmann's constant]].
