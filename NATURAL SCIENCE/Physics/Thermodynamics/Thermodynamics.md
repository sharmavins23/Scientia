Thermodynamics is a [[Physics|physical]] branch of science dealing with [[Heat|heat]], [[Work (Thermodynamics)|work]], and [[Temperature|temperature]], as well as their relations to [[Energy|energy]], [[Entropy|entropy]], and the physical properties of [[Matter|matter]] and [[Radiation|radiation]].

Thermodynamics is namely governed by four laws:

1. If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
2. In a closed system, change in internal energy of the system $\Delta U_{system}$ is equal to the difference between the [[Heat|heat]] supplied to the system $Q$ and the [[Work (Thermodynamics)|work]] done $W$ by the system on its surroundings: $\Delta U_{system} = Q - W$.
	1. This law is a variant of the [[Law of Conservation of Energy|law of conservation of energy]] adapted for thermodynamic processes.
	2. The concept of energy is broken down into [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] $KE_{system}$, [[Potential Energy|potential energy]] $PE_{system}$, and internal energy $U_{system}$ such that $E_{total} = KE_{system} + PE_{system} + U_{system}$.
	3. When matter is transferred into a system, the internal and potential energy associated with said matter is transferred into the new system: $(u\Delta M)_{in} = \Delta U_{system}$.
	4. The flow of heat is a form of energy transfer.
3. When two initially isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium with itself but not necess
