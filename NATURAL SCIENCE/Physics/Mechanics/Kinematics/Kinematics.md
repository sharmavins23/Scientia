Kinematics is a branch of [[Mechanics|mechanics]] that studies [[Motion|motion]] of objects without reference to their cause. It is also referred to as 'classical mechanics', and is an accurate way of describing the motion of massive bodies.

In general, motion can be mathematically described by Newton's three laws of motion:

1. In an [[Inertial Frame of Reference|inertial reference frame]], an object either remains at rest or continues to move in a straight line at constant [[Velocity|velocity]], unless acted upon by a net [[Force|force]].
2. In an [[Inertial Frame of Reference|inertial reference frame]], the [[Vector|vector]] sum of the forces $F$ on an object is equal to the [[Mass|mass]] $m$ of that object multiplied by the acceleration $a$ of the object, or $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$.
	1. Importantly, this above equation applies for constant-mass systems; Force $\vec{F}$ is more correctly equal to the change in [[Momentum|momentum]] over [[Time|time]] ($\vec{F}=\frac{\Delta m \vec{v}}{\Delta t}$).
3. When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the first body.
