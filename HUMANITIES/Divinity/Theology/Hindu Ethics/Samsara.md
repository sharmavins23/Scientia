Samsara, literally translated, means "wandering" as well as "word". The term, however, refers to the "cyclic change" or "cyclicity of all life". It is a fundamental belief of [[Hinduism]]. When related to the theory of [[Karma|karma]], samsara also takes on the meaning of "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence."

While the concept of samsara has roots in post-Vedic literature, the theory is not discussed in the [[Vedas]] themselves. Instead, the concept appears in developed form in the early [[Upanishads]].

## Definition

The earliest Vedic texts incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell (based on cumulative virtues, or karma). However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi|Rishis]] dismissed this idea as simplistic, because people do not live equally moral or immoral lives. It would be unfair for god [[Yama]] to judge and reward people with varying degrees of virtue or vices in this way.

As such, they introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit. Once this term is lived out, one returns and is reborn. This cycle of drifting can be broken through [[Moksha|moksha]].
