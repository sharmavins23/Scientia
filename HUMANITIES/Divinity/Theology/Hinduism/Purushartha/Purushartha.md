Literally translated, purushartha means "objective of men." It refers to four proper goals or aims of a human life:

1. [[Dharma]]
2. [[Artha]]
3. [[Kama]]
4. [[Moksha]]

## Importance and Tension

While moksha is considered the ultimate goal in life, the four are ordered (above) in relative importance. In cases of conflict, dharma is considerably more important; Then artha, then kama. However, many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scholars and texts disagree on this.

The active pursuit of kama (and to a lesser extent, artha) directly exhibit tension with moksha. This led to the concepts of pravritti (giving or devoting one's self to) and nivritti (withdrawing and restraining one's self from) being developed. Artha and kama are pravrtti; Moksha is nivrtti. [[Manusmriti]] describes it as follows:

> *Activity, according to orthodox tradition, is of two kinds: pravrtti and nivrtti,*
> *The first kind of activity leads to progress ([[abhyudaya]]), and the second, to perfection ([[nihsreyasa]]).*

Indian scholars offered a creative resolution to this tension - The best of both worlds may be achieved by dedicating oneself to 'action with renunciation', or 'action without attachment or craving for results.' Actions must be engaged in because they are dharma - They are good, virtuous, rights, a duty or moral activity, and not because of craving for material rewards.
