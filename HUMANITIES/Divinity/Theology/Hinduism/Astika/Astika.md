Astika and nastika are concepts used to classify the orthodox and unorthodox schools of Hinduism (respectively). Literally translated, astika means "there exists", referring to the existence of one's soul. The following three definitions for astika have been posited:

1. Those who accept the authority of the [[Vedas|Vedas]];
2. Those who accept the existence of the [[Atman|atman]];
3. Those who accept the existence of [[Ishvara]] (God).

In contrast, nastika refers to those who do not fall into the prior categories.
