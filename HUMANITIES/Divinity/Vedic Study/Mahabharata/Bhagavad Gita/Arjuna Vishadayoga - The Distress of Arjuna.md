## Overview

The chapter begins with Emperor [[Dhrtarastra]], the king of the [[Kaurava|Kauravas]], asking [[Sanjaya]] what occurred at the holy battlefield of [[Kurukshetra]] (referred in text as the battlefield of [[Dharma|dharma]]). Sanjaya begins by describing the Kauravan king [[Duryodhana|Duryodhana's]] remarks upon the two militaries.

Duryodhana describes the forces of the [[Pandava|Pandavas]]: Strong and expertly skilled in war, archers as strong as [[Arjuna]] and as powerful as [[Bhima]]. However, the might of the Kauravan army is also mentioned: [[Bhisma]], among others, are all experts in war.

Duryodhana declares that the Kauravan army, protected by the might of Bhisma, is unlimited - The Pandavan army, protected by Bhima is insufficient. As such, the Kauravan battle plan is to support and protect Bhisma at all costs. At that moment, Bhisma blew loudly into his conch, rallying all troops to follow suit.

On the other side of the battlefield, [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] blew their conches. [[Bhima]] and the remainder of the Pandavan forces follow suit - This loud noise shatters the hearts of the Kauravan warriors.

Just before the battle was to start, Arjuna, observing his enemies across the battlefield, readies his bow and speaks to Krishna. He asks Krishna, his charioteer, to drive amidst the battlefield, so that he may see his enemies' wicked faces. Krishna obliges.

"O Arjuna, behold the Kaurava Dynasty assembled here!" Krishna speaks. There, in front of him, Arjuna sees all of his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, brothers, sons, grandsons, fathers-in-law, and friends, on both sides of the battlefield. Seeing all of his relatives in front of him on the battlefield, Arjuna folds over in grief.

"O Krishna, seeing all my relatives assembled here and preparing for battle, the strength drains from my limbs and my mouth becomes parched." Arjuna fails to muster up strength, entering a state of panic. He asks Krishna - What use is a kingdom when all relatives are dying for it? What happiness may come from killing one's own kin?

Arjuna delves into more depth with his slippery-slope argument. Why kill one's family? By killing one's relatives, family values and cultures are lost. This leads to women of the family becoming degraded. When women become degraded, any children and future generations are raised poorly. Such terrible offspring annihilate traditions of family and society, and leave a world to rot.

With these words, Arjuna states that he'd rather be killed unarmed by the Kauravas, throws his bow and arrows on the floor of the chariot, and cries.
