## Overview

Krishna looks at Arjuna, and speaks the following phrase: "Whence has come to thee this stain (this dejection) of spirit in this hour of crisis? It is unknown to men of noble mind; It does not lead to heaven; It causes disgrace, O Arjuna." Krishna urges Arjuna to cease his current state of mind.

Arjuna replies, asking how he could possibly counterattack his respected peers. He states how it is better to live as a beggar than to taint the [[Artha|artha]] he may enjoy from winning such a war with their blood. After complaining, Arjuna asks Krishna for advice, before continuing to complain. "Even if I gain a substantial kingdom beyond compare and the power of the demigods, I see nothing that can remove this grief that is eroding my senses. O Krishna, O Govinda, I will not fight!"

To this Krishna smiles and responds: "While you speak words of wisdom, you are mourning for that which is not worthy of grief. The wise lament neither for the living nor the dead." 

Krishna explains that all of the warriors here have always existed, and will always continue to exist. As the [[Atman|soul]] passes through childhood, youth, adulthood and old age, so too shall it transfer to another body. Those who are wise shouldn't feel saddened about this - It's the natural order of things.

Just as one may feel heat or cold, pleasure or pain, these feelings are temporary, and must be learned to tolerate them. One who remains composed in both pleasure and pain and remains undisturbed is capable of attaining [[Moksha|moksha]].

Things that are temporary cease to be quickly; Things that are eternal cannot die or be erased. Anyone who can see Truth understands this - The soul itself is also eternal, and can never be destroyed. Only the material body may die. "Therefore, fight, O Arjuna," Krishna re-iterates.

He then describes how, due to this eternal nature, one can neither be considered a slayer nor slain; Neither occurs. The soul neither takes birth nor dies; It has never been created nor will it ever be. It is eternal, indestructible, timeless - It will never be destroyed. If the core atom of a human is indestructible, how may a person kill? Who ends up dying?

Krishna explains further that the soul cannot be destroyed; It simply changes bodies like one changes clothes. It cannot be touched, or felt, or stabbed or slashed. With this, Krishna tells Arjuna that, with the soul being this way, there is no reason to lament.

"Even if you believe that the individual consciousness is eternally subject to birth and death, still you have no reason to lament, O Arjuna." Krishna proposes a new argument here - If one does experience birth, they must eventually die; One who dies must eventually be reborn. Thus, Arjuna should not grieve over inevitabilities.

"Moreover," Krishna states, "considering your natural duty, you should not waver, as there is no better course of action for a warrior than a war of righteousness." Krishna states here that such a war is lucky for a warrior to have - It is a free ticket to betterment. 

But by abstaining, Arjuna's principles of [[Dharma|dharma]] will be lost, alongside his fame, and he will incur negative [[Karma|karma]]. For time to come, people could speak of Arjuna's infamy, of his cowardice. Krishna argues that if Arjuna is killed in battle, he simply attains positive [[Karma|karma]], and if he is a victor he enjoys the earth. Therefore, he should be confident in his choice to fight.

Krishna ceases to argue, mentioning that He has stated His case. "Now hear how to act upon this knowledge, through which you will be able to release yourself from the bondage of action."

Krishna states that there is no downside to performing dharma. "Even the slightest effort saves one from the greatest fear." 

He describes that those "of small intelligence" misinterpret the [[Vedas]] and claim that there are many rituals to award higher birth, wealth, power, and enjoyment. Through these ideas these people lose focus of the Supreme.

Krishna then elaborates on the interpretation of the Vedas. He says that the Vedas describe three modes ([[Guna|Gunas]]) of material nature, and by rising above false dualities Arjuna may transcend these.

Krishna begins to describe [[Yoga]]: "Your right is to perform your work, but never to the results." One should be composed in both success and failure, never seeking the rewards of one's labors. Yoga is the balance of these concepts - Performing one's activities and giving up attachments to the destination.

The wise refrain from performing either good or bad actions in the world; They only engage in yoga. As the wise give up the results of their actions, they free themselves from the bondage of material birth and death. When one's mind ceases to be captivated by the fruits of the Vedas and instead withdraws further, one attains perfection in yoga.

Arjuna then asks Krishna how a person who is enlightened talks, sits, or walks. Krishna responds by describing how they act - One whose mind remains undisturbed by distress, who has no desire for pleasure, who is free from mundane attachment, fear, or anger, is such an enlightened person. Krishna describes one who is "wise" as one who is wholly unattached to anything in the world, and is neither joyful nor resentful on attaining good or evil.

Krishna mentions that a person aspiring to become enlightened may renounce his senses, but those senses will still remain. This will eventually cease; However, those senses can forcibly unfocus any mind. It is the restraint of all senses that steps towards moksha.

By meditating on senses, one becomes attached to them; From attachment springs forth desire; From desire springs forth anger. Anger gives birth to delusion; Delusion causes bewilderment of memory, and the loss of intelligence. "When the intellect is destroyed, one is ruined," Krishna warns.

However, one who can control the mind gains peace. In that peace all pains are destroyed, for the intellect steadies. The mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses may only be carried away like a boat on choppy waters; "Therefore, O Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained!"
