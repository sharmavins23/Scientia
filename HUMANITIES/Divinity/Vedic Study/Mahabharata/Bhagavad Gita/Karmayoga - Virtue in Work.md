## Overview

[[Arjuna]] says to [[Krishna]]: "If you say the path of knowledge is more excellent than the path of action, why do you urge me to fight?" Krishna responds, describing two potential paths for enlightenment:

- For those of erudite and contemplative mind, the path of knowledge ([[Samkhya]]). One simply cannot renounce worldly belongings to attain [[Moksha|enlightenment]].
- For those of action, the path of work. One can never free themselves from work by simply not working.

Krishna proceeds to focus on the path of work. For nobody can stop themselves from working - "Everyone is made to act helplessly by the impulses born of nature. He who restrains his organs of action but continues in his mind to brood over the objects of sense... is said to be a hypocrite."

"But he who controls the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, and without attachment engages the organs of action in the path of work, he is superior." Krishna iterates over his main point - That action is better than inaction, and that work should be done in sacrifice ([[Karma|karma]]). He states that sacrifice is godly - As karma was born of God, so too do both God and Godly things stay close to sacrifice. Those who do not work, who do not live in the spirit of self-sacrifice, live in vain and in sin.

Krishna elaborates on a series of concrete principles that one can focus on:

- Be satisfied in the self. Krishna discusses how the liberated man, who cares not for the world nor what the world offers to him, but simply does work for the welfare of others, attains to the highest.
- Set an example to others. Krishna points out king [[Janaka]], father of [[Sita]], as as one who attained perfection by works - Whatever a great man does, others will follow.
- The self is no doer. As all work is completed as a consequence of natural order, one should be unattached to the work as well as the reward, for they did not really perform it.
- The enemy is desire and anger. Craving and desire confound the senses, mind, intelligence, and soul. Wrath is the progenitor of sin.
